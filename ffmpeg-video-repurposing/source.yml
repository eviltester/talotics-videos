      # Videos Auto Play On Mobile

      * Audio is off by default
      * Talking head videos look silly

      # Options CC or Burned In

      * Linkedin supports closed captions
      * Instagram needs hard captions

    narration: I could upload a subtitle file to Linkedin, but I'd have to edit that for the excerpt.
    narration: Or I can use hard captions, "burned in" to the video to avoid that problem.

  - narration: I want to promote my YouTube videos on Linkedin, and Instagram. To do that I want to create smaller excerpts of my YouTube videos and have these promote the main video on YouTube. 
    slide: |
      # Repurposing YouTube videos
      
      * create smaller excerpts
      * link them to YouTube

  - narration: Short videos work really well on Instagram, and Linkedin, when people are scrolling through their feed.
    slide: |
      # Short Videos for Feed Viewing

      * Linkedin
      * Instagram

  - narration: On mobile devices videos in the feed auto play. And if you have a video with a talking head, people will see the talking head, but they won't hear the audio. And that just looks silly.
    slide: |
      # Videos Auto Play On Mobile

      * Audio is off by default
      * Talking heads, with no sound, look silly

  - narration: I could upload a subtitle file to Linkedin, but I'd have to edit that for the excerpt. Or, I can use hard captions, "burned in", to the video to avoid that problem.
    slide: |
      # Options: CC or Burned In

      * Linkedin supports Closed Captions
      * Instagram needs Burned In Hard Captions

- narration: I use ffmpeg, free command line software, to help with this.
    slide: |
        # FFMPEG is free

        * command line software
        * can be complicated
        * multi-platform: Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.
        * https://www.ffmpeg.org

- narration: Let me walk you through the workflow I use for taking a YouTube video, with subtitles, and converting it into smaller videos with burned in subtitles.
    slide: |
       # YouTube to Instagram Workflow

       * YouTube video
       * Video has subtitles file
       * Download files
       * Use FFMPEG to burn in subtitles
       * Use FFMPEG to format video to different sizes
       * Use FFMPEG to extract sections

- narration: Here's a video on YouTube. It's only four minutes, but I can easily get three or four short videos out of this, that I can use to promote on Linkedin and Instagram.
    slide: |
      # Show 4 min video

- narration: First I want to download the mp4 file. And I want to download the subtitle file as a `.srt` file.
    slide: |
      # Show download mp4, and download subtitles

- narration: I'll use ffmpeg to generate a `.ass` subtitle file so I can burn it on to the video.
    slide: |
      # FFMPEG Command to create `.ass` file

      ~~~~~~~~
      ffmpeg -i captions.srt captions.ass
      ~~~~~~~~
    
- narration: And I'll burn it on to the video like this. You might want to copy and paste from the video description. When you type it in, it all goes on one line.
    slide: |
      # FFMPEG Command to burn in subtitles

      ~~~~~~~~
      ffmpeg -i video.mp4  
      -vf "subtitles=captions.ass:
      force_style='OutlineColour=&H80000000,BorderStyle=4,
      Outline=1,Shadow=0,MarginV=20'"
       subtitled-video.mp4
      ~~~~~~~~

- narration: I also want to create a video resized for Instagram, I can use `ffmpeg` to do that as well.
    slide: |
      # FFMPEG `scale` to format for Instagram

      ~~~~~~~~
      ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vf 
      scale=720:720:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease,
      pad=720:720
       instagram-sized.mp4
      ~~~~~~~~

- narration: I can burn the subtitles on to this video too.
    slide: |
      # FFMPEG burn in subtitles to the Instagram video

      ~~~~~~~~
      ffmpeg -i instaoutout.mp4 -vf 
      "subtitles=captions.ass:force_style=
      'OutlineColour=&H80000000,BorderStyle=4,Outline=1,Shadow=0,MarginV=90'"
       instagram-subs.mp4
      ~~~~~~~~

- narration: I want to create 3 new videos from my original, and I've watched the video so I know I want sections from a point in the video for a specific length of time in seconds.
    slide: |

    # Use FFMPEG to create those sections for Instagram

    * from 01:05 for 52 seconds
    * from 02:00 for 33 seconds
    * from 03:10 for 51 seconds

    e.g.

    ~~~~~~~~
    ffmpeg -i instagram-subs.mp4 -ss 00:01:05 -t 00:00:52 instagram-01-05.mp4
    ~~~~~~~~

- narration: That was for instagram, now I'll create one for linkedin. The only difference is the input file.
      If I repeat that for each of the segments, I'll have three videos that I can upload to Linkedin, and three that I can upload to Instagram. All will have subtitles visible on the screen.
    slide: |

    # Use FFMPEG to create those sections for Landscape Videos

    ~~~~~~~~
    ffmpeg -i subtitled-video.mp4 -ss 00:01:05 -t 00:00:52 subtitled-01-05.mp4
    ~~~~~~~~

- narration: It seems complicated, but if all you learned how to do was copy and paste the commands and replace the filenames with the files you're working with, and the timings that you want to use as excerpts.

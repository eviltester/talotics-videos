  - narration: But if you have a video with a talking head, people will see your mouth moving, but they won't hear the audio. And that just looks silly.
    slide: |
      # Videos Auto Play On Mobile

      * Audio is off by default
      * Talking heads, with no sound, look silly

  - narration: I could upload a subtitle file to Linkedin, but I'd have to edit that for each excerpt. Or, I can use hard captions, "burned in", to the video to avoid that problem.
    slide: |
      # Options: CC or Burned In

      * Linkedin supports Closed Captions
      * Each excerpt video would need a new subtitle file
      * Instagram needs Burned In Hard Captions

  - narration: I use ffmpeg to help with this. The software is free and runs from the command line. Although, that can make it seem quite complicated. You can download it from www.ffmpeg.org

        # FFMPEG is free

        * command line software
        * can be complicated
        * multi-platform: Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.

  - narration: Let me walk you through the workflow I use for taking a YouTube video, with subtitles, and converting it into smaller videos with the subtitle text burned in.

       # YouTube to Instagram Workflow

       * YouTube video
       * Video has subtitles file
       * Download files
       * Use FFMPEG to burn in subtitles
       * Use FFMPEG to format video to different sizes
       * Use FFMPEG to extract sections

  - narration: Here's a video on YouTube. It's only four minutes long, but I can easily re-purpose this and get three or four short videos.

      # Download

      * download mp4 from the video list
      * download subtitles from the video edit screen

  - narration: I'll use ffmpeg to generate a different format of subtitle file.

      # FFMPEG Command to create a `.ass` file

      ```console
      ffmpeg -i captions.srt captions.ass
      ```

  - narration: I can use this format to burn it on to the video.

  - narration: I burn the subtitles on to the video using the subtitles filter. You might want to copy and paste from the video description. When you type it in, it all goes on one line.
    slide: |
      # FFMPEG Command to burn in subtitles

      ```console
      ffmpeg -i video.mp4  
      -vf "subtitles=captions.ass:
      force_style='OutlineColour=&H80000000,BorderStyle=4,
      Outline=1,Shadow=0,MarginV=20'"
       subtitled-video.mp4
      ```

      

  - narration: Now I have a video with subtitles burned in, perfect for uploading to Linkedin or Twitter.

  - narration: I also want to create a video sized for Instagram. I can use the scale filter from ffmpeg to do that.
    slide: |
      # FFMPEG `scale` to format for Instagram

      ```console
      ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vf 
      scale=720:720:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease,
      pad=720:720
       instagram-sized.mp4
      ```
  
  - narration: This video is square, but I don't have any subtitles on this yet.

  - narration: I can burn in the subtitles for this video as well.
    slide: |
      # FFMPEG burn in subtitles to the Instagram video

      ```console
      ffmpeg -i instagram-sized.mp4 -vf 
      "subtitles=captions.ass:force_style=
      'OutlineColour=&H80000000,BorderStyle=4,
      Outline=1,Shadow=0,MarginV=90'"
       instagram-subs.mp4
      ```

  - narration: Now I have a video which is perfect for uploading to Instagram. But it is too long. I need to cut it into smaller sections.
    image:

      size: contain

  - narration: I want to create 3 new videos from my original. I watch the video to identify which sections I need to extract. Each section starts from a point in the video and lasts for a specific length of time in seconds.
    slide: |

      # Use FFMPEG to create those sections for Instagram

      * from 01:05 for 52 seconds
      * from 02:00 for 33 seconds
      * from 03:10 for 51 seconds

      ```console
      ffmpeg -i instagram-subs.mp4 
      -ss 00:01:05 -t 00:00:52 instagram-01-05.mp4
      ```

  - narration: That was for instagram, and now I have a fifty two second video, with subtitles, which is the right shape and length to upload to instagram.

  - narration:  Now I'll create one for linkedin. The only differences are the input file and output file name.      
    slide: |

      # Use FFMPEG to create those sections for Landscape Videos

      ```console
      ffmpeg -i subtitled-video.mp4
      -ss 00:01:05 -t 00:00:52 subtitled-01-05.mp4
      ```

  - narration: If I repeat this for each of the segments, I'll have three videos that I can upload to Linkedin or Twitter, and three that I can upload to Instagram. All will have subtitles visible on the screen.

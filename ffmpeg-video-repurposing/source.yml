  - narration: I want to promote my YouTube videos on Linkedin, and Instagram. To do that I want to create smaller excerpts of my YouTube videos and have these promote the main video on YouTube.

      # Repurposing YouTube videos
      
      * create smaller excerpts
      * link them to YouTube

  - narration: Short videos work really well on Instagram, and Linkedin, when people are scrolling through their feed.

      # Short Videos for Feed Viewing

      * Linkedin
      * Instagram

  - narration: On mobile devices videos in the feed auto play. And if you have a video with a talking head, people will see the talking head, but they won't hear the audio.    
    slide: |
      # Videos Auto Play On Mobile

      * Audio is off by default
      * Talking head videos look silly

  - narration: I could upload a subtitle file to Linkedin, but I'd have to edit that for the excerpt.
      Or I can use hard captions, "burned in" to the video to avoid that problem.
    slide: |
      # Options: CC or Burned In

      * Linkedin supports Closed Captions
      * Instagram needs Burned In Hard Captions

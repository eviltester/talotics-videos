      # Repurposing YouTube videos
      
      * create smaller excerpts
      * link them to YouTube

      # Short Videos for Feed Viewing

      * Linkedin
      * Instagram

  - narration: On mobile devices videos in the feed auto play. And if you have a video with a talking head, people will see the talking head, but they won't hear the audio. And that just looks silly.

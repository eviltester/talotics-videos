      # Repurposing YouTube videos
      
      * create smaller excerpts
      * link them to YouTube

  - narration: On mobile devices, videos auto play when shown in the feed. And if you have a video with a talking head, people will see the talking head, but they won't hear the audio. And that just looks silly.
    slide: |
      # Videos Auto Play On Mobile

      * Audio is off by default
      * Talking heads, with no sound, look silly

  - narration: I could upload a subtitle file to Linkedin, but I'd have to edit that for the excerpt. Or, I can use hard captions, "burned in", to the video to avoid that problem.
    slide: |
      # Options: CC or Burned In

      * Linkedin supports Closed Captions
      * Instagram needs Burned In Hard Captions

  - narration: I use ffmpeg to help with this. The software is free and runs from the command line. Although that can make it seem quite complicated. You can download it from www.ffmpeg.org

        # FFMPEG is free

        * command line software
        * can be complicated
        * multi-platform: Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.

  - narration: Let me walk you through the workflow I use for taking a YouTube video, with subtitles, and converting it into smaller videos with the subtitles burned in.
    slide: |
       # YouTube to Instagram Workflow

       * YouTube video
       * Video has subtitles file
       * Download files
       * Use FFMPEG to burn in subtitles
       * Use FFMPEG to format video to different sizes
       * Use FFMPEG to extract sections

  - narration: Here's a video on YouTube. It's only four minutes, but I can easily get three or four short videos out of this. I can use those to promote on Linkedin and Instagram.

  - narration: First I want to download the video mp4 file. And I want to download the subtitles as an srt file.
    slide: |
      # Download

      * download mp4 from the video list
      * download subtitles from the video edit screen

  - narration: I'll use ffmpeg to generate a different format of subtitle file so I can burn it on to the video.

      # FFMPEG Command to create a `.ass` file

      ~~~~~~~~
      ffmpeg -i captions.srt captions.ass
      ~~~~~~~~

  - narration: I burn the subtitles on to the video like this. You might want to copy and paste from the video description. When you type it in, it all goes on one line.
    slide: |
      # FFMPEG Command to burn in subtitles

      ~~~~~~~~
      ffmpeg -i video.mp4

      force_style='OutlineColour=&H80000000,BorderStyle=4,
      Outline=1,Shadow=0,MarginV=20'"
       subtitled-video.mp4

  - narration: I also want to create a video sized for Instagram. I can use the scale filter from ffmpeg to do that.
    slide: |
      # FFMPEG `scale` to format for Instagram

      ~~~~~~~~
      ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vf

  - narration: I can burn in the subtitles for this video as well.

      # FFMPEG burn in subtitles to the Instagram video

      ffmpeg -i instaoutout.mp4 -vf

  - narration: I want to create 3 new videos from my original. I watch the video to identify which sections I need to extract. Each section starts from a point in the video and lasts for a specific length of time in seconds.
    slide: |

      # Use FFMPEG to create those sections for Instagram

      * from 01:05 for 52 seconds
      * from 02:00 for 33 seconds
      * from 03:10 for 51 seconds

      ~~~~~~~~
      ffmpeg -i instagram-subs.mp4 
      -ss 00:01:05 -t 00:00:52 instagram-01-05.mp4
      ~~~~~~~~

  - narration: That was for instagram, now I'll create one for linkedin. The only difference is the input file.
      If I repeat this for each of the segments, I'll have three videos that I can upload to Linkedin or Twitter, and three that I can upload to Instagram. All will have subtitles visible on the screen.

      # Use FFMPEG to create those sections for Landscape Videos

      ~~~~~~~~
      ffmpeg -i subtitled-video.mp4
      -ss 00:01:05 -t 00:00:52 subtitled-01-05.mp4
      ~~~~~~~~

  - narration: It seems complicated, but if you copy and paste the commands and change the filenames and timings for your sections, you could easily be using Free software to repurpose your YouTube content on Linkedin, Instagram and other social networks. And you can do this without having to do any more edits to the YouTube video or subtitles.
